# Java DSA/OOP Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects that demonstrate core concepts in Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Each project focuses on solving algorithmic problems and implementing foundational data structures using Java.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Expression Evaluation (Infix ↔ Postfix)
- Exception Handling
- File I/O & JUnit Testing
- Recursion & Sorting
- Graphs and Pathfinding (Dijkstra's Algorithm)

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)
- JUnit 4/5
- VScode
- JavaFX

## 📁 Project List

| Project                          | Description                                                                          |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PasswordChecker`                | Validates user passwords with custom exception handling.                             |
| `ExpressionConverter`            | Converts infix expressions to postfix and evaluates them using stacks.               |
| `CustomQueueStack`               | Implements generic Stack and Queue classes with linked lists.                        |
| `MorseCodeConverter`             | Uses tree traversal to translate between Morse code and English text.                |
| `HolidayBonusUtility`            | Processes ragged 2D arrays and calculates holiday bonuses.                           |
| `TownGraphManager`               | Models a network of towns and roads using graph structures and Dijkstra’s algorithm. |
